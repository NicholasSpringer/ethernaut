This level shows the danger of the rewards being stolen for puzzles or knowledge of secrets. Because nothing on the chain is private, once one user reveals their solution, other users can try to steal the reward. One strategy is to copy the solver's transaction with a higher gas price so that the attacker's transaction will be mined first and they will successfully take the reward.
